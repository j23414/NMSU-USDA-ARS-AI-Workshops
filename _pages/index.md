This site contains learning materials for two AI Workshops run by New Mexico State University and the [USDA Agricultural Research Service](https://ars.usda.gov):

 - AI Workshop 1: Intro to Image Processing, Classical Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
 - AI Workshop 2: Advanced Topics in Deep Learning for Image Proccessing
 
{% include feature_row %}


The workshops cover the basics of image processing using classical machine learning techniques as well as provide more in-depth exploration of some common deep learning architectures used in image processing. Participants are introduced to the basic concepts via powerpoint lecture and guided through hands-on programming in an interactive jupyter notebook framework. 


By the end of Workshop 1 participants should be able to: 1) , 2) , 3) , 4) , and 5) .


By the end of Workshop 2 participants should be able to: 1) , 2) , 3) , 4) , and 5) .
